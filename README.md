Hello Mission to Mars!



Story 1: I didn't struggle on coding this one I got used to the set up, loop format. Setting up Git was a bit difficult but I now understand its usefulness.



Story 2: I found this task quite easy as I have gotten the hang of coding in the Arduino and using Git.



Story 3: This task wasn't too difficult but lots of lines of code for forward, stop etc. making the code difficult to read through and check.



Story 4: Functions made the previous task a lot easier! I can now later go through my work and immediately understand what each section is doing - not having to go through line by line to figure out if the code makes the robot move forward or back. 



Story 5: Creating the left and right functions was a challenge - I realised that I needed to create an imbalance between the speeds of the left and right motors to trigger turning but struggled to decide by how much to differ the speeds. 



Story 6: This story wasn't too hard though I had to decide how to implement it - using a while loop or using delay(). I decided that using a while loop made my code cleaner to read and follow. 



Story 7: I enjoyed doing this task - a combination of functions and loops for square movement. I did struggle at first with making a precise 90 degree turn left and right - I think the speed at which this is done is specific to the motor and wheels so I decide to leave it digitally as HIGH for now. 



Story 8: I didn't struggle too much on this task as I needed to blend the New Ping sensor code with code from previous stories - I had already coded the functions needed apart from sensor code so it was more about getting the actual logic of what the robot needs to achieve right.



Story 9: I really enjoyed thinking of a solution to this one - once again I already had the functions needed to solve this from previous stories so it was beyond just writing code and more about problem solving.
